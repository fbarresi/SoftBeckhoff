# SoftBeckhoff
![.NET Core](https://github.com/fbarresi/SoftBeckhoff/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

This project was inspired by [SoftPlc](https://github.com/fbarresi/SoftPlc) and aims to reach the same goal: a virtual PLC (a Beckhoff in this case) for testing usage.

Beckhoff PLCs communicates with the ADS Protocol. Since there are no opensouce ADS Servers I wrote a simple one with reverse engineering.

Please note that this software is still under development.
